# tic_tac_toe_js

## About this project

This is the Tic Tac Toe project from The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Javascript Course. You can see the full specifications of the assignment here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript

This project is a simple tic tac toe game with a front end user interface. The game's functionality and the interactive display are written in Javascript, with CSS for stylings and layout. 

## Challenges

This project was all about organizing code using factory functions and modules. The goal being to keep functions and objects private unless absolutely necessary. My own personal focus I layered to this was working on following the single responsibility principle. It was a tough adjustment at first being more used to Ruby classes and scope, but I was ultimately able to get used to these concepts in JS and find my footing.

I struggled at times to reconcile event listeners with the flow of the game, as I wasn't able to use some of the same patterns, loops, and conditionals I would in Ruby or Python. I solved this by reconfiguring my logic so I didn't need to change the event listener depending on the conditional. Instead I put much of the game loop logic with the event listener so the sequence would fire off correctly.
