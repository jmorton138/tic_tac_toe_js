## Challenges

This project was all about organizing code using factory functions and modules. The goal being to keep functions and objects private unless absolutely necessary. My own personal focus I layered to this was working on following the single responsibility principle. I struggled at times to reconcile event listeners with the flow of the game, as I wasn't able to use some of the same patterns, loops, and conditionals I would in Ruby or Python. I solved this by reconfiguring my logic so I didn't need to change the event listener depending on the conditional. Instead I put much of the game loop logic with the event listener so the sequence would fire off correctly.
